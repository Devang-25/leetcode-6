## Description

Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
OR in other words,
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.

## Example 1

```
Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 3 5]

Output : [3 3 5]
```

## Example 2

```
Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 5]

Output : [3 5]
```

## Note

For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.
